Welcome! I’m **Gastão Krein**, a theoretical physicist at IFT–UNESP (São Paulo, Brazil).  
My research interests include quantum chromodynamics (QCD), confinement, dynamical chiral symmetry breaking, and related nonperturbative phenomena. I also teach courses on quantum information and computation.

This site mirrors the simple layout you see above: **Books and courses**, **Research papers**, and **Other writing**. You’ll find links to lecture notes, selected publications, and occasional essays.

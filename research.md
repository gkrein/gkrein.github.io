# Research

My research focuses on **theoretical physics**, especially in the area of **Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)**, the theory of the strong interactions. I am particularly interested in understanding:

- **Confinement**: how quarks and gluons are permanently bound into hadrons.  
- **Dynamical chiral symmetry breaking**: the mechanism by which massless quarks acquire effective masses.  
- **Center vortices and gluon mass generation**: exploring topological configurations of the QCD vacuum.  
- **Properties of QCD matter** under extreme conditions (high temperature, high density, strong magnetic fields).

## Current projects
- **Center-vortex framework for gluon mass generation**  
  Developing continuum approaches to describe gluon propagators and mass generation, supported by lattice QCD results.  

- **QCD in strong magnetic fields**  
  Studying the behavior of quark condensates and meson properties in magnetars and heavy-ion collisions.  

- **Percolation in dense nuclear matter**  
  Investigating quark delocalization in neutron star matter and possible percolation transitions.

## Collaborations
I frequently collaborate with colleagues in Brazil and abroad on topics ranging from Dyson–Schwinger equations and Bethe–Salpeter kernels to effective field theories for hadronic matter.

## Perspective
The unifying theme of my work is to **connect fundamental QCD mechanisms to observable phenomena** in nuclear and particle physics, bridging the gap between lattice results, continuum field-theory methods, and phenomenological models.

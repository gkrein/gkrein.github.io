I’m a Research Professor at the Institute of Theoretical Physics (IFT) of the State University of São Paulo (UNESP). 

I obtained my Doctoral degree in Physics from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul.

Before joining the IFT, I was a Full Professor at the Federal University of Santa Maria. 

My research lies in theoretical studies of the strong interaction, with quantum chromodynamics (QCD) as its underlying theory. I focus on nonperturbative aspects of QCD, including quark–gluon confinement, dynamical mass generation, hadron structure and interactions, and the behavior of strongly interacting matter at finite temperature and high density. More recently, I have also become interested in exploring applications of quantum information and computation in nuclear and particle physics.

My teaching includes regular courses of the IFT graduate program and outreach lectures, some of which are described in **Teaching** link.
